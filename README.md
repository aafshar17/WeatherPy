# Weather Py

## Project Description

Project WeatherPy is a learning project on how to use the Python requests library,citipy library, and openweathermapy module in conjuction with Pandas and Matplotlib.  

The purpose of the project is to create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Build a series of scatter plots to show the relationship between latitude and a few other city variables.
 
## Observations

 1. As expected, the max temperature of cities increases as their latitude gets closer to zero/closer to the equator and decreases as
    their distance increases from the equator/latitude of zero.

 2. Cities that are closer to the equator or have a latitude close to zero have lower wind speeds than those that are farther away from
    the equator.

 3. No observable trend in cloudiness percentage when it comes to latitude of cities relative to their distance from the equator.
